In the proposed study I will be investigating the usage of a game engine (Unity)to make a simple 2D or 3D game to be used on PC. I will investigate how and why Unity is used for game development as opposed to other game engines such as Unreal, Corona or ShiVa. I intend to show my knowledge of the topic I have learnt by Discussing various questions and topic related to Unity as well as creating a simple 2D game using some of the feature, scripts (functions), and setting that are available on Unity.  <br />
